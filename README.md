# RedPitaya_GenApp

RedPitaya GenApp is a **GTKmm-based graphical application** designed to **manage, configure, and deploy CNN models** to RedPitaya devices.  
The app offers **offline and online export modes**, **RSA key management**, and full **SSH-based deployment**, enabling seamless integration of **machine learning models into embedded hardware.**

It is modular, clean, and ready for use in **real-time AI applications** where RedPitaya serves as the main processing hardware.

Each version includes:

- `buttonsHandler/` — Modular handlers for UI buttons.
- `Utility/` — Core utility modules: SSHManager, RSAKeyDialog, ExportManager, etc.
- `gen_files/` (offline only) — Embedded components: CMSIS libraries, ADC/DAC code, real-time handlers (mutex, semaphore, etc.).

## 🛠 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aymanehajjaoui/RedPitaya_GenApp.git
cd RedPitaya_GenApp
```

### 2️⃣ Build the app

**Offline version:**

```bash
cd Source_Code/RedPitaya_GenApp_Offline
make
```

**Online version:**

```bash
cd Source_Code/RedPitaya_GenApp_Online
make
```

🔧 *Note: You can also clean and rebuild using:*

```bash
make clean && make
```

---

## 🚦 Usage

### Launch the application:

- **Offline:**
  ```bash
  ./RedPitaya_GenApp_Offline/gen_app
  ```

- **Online:**
  ```bash
  ./RedPitaya_GenApp_Online/gen_app
  ```

### Main buttons:

- **Browse Model:**  
  Select a CNN model folder (generated by Qualia or custom).

- **Export Locally:**  
  Exports the model to your local directory (for testing or backup).

- **Connect to RedPitaya:**  
  SSH connection management with RSA key support (no password needed once set up).

- **Export to RedPitaya:**  
  Deploys the selected CNN model to RedPitaya over SSH.

- **Help / Quit:**  
  Access help documentation or exit the application.

---

## 🔑 RSA Key Management

- **Generate RSA key:**  
  Creates an SSH key pair for secure connections.

- **Copy RSA key to RedPitaya:**  
  Automatically uploads your public key for passwordless SSH login.

**Modules involved:**
- `RSAKeyDialog`
- `SSHManager`

---

## 🧱 Advanced Modes (Offline)

Inside `gen_files/` you will find **different architectures**:

- `process_mutex/` — Multi-process using mutex synchronization
- `process_sem/` — Multi-process using semaphores
- `threads_mutex/` — Multi-threaded using mutex
- `threads_sem/` — Multi-threaded using semaphores (optimized for real-time)

Each contains:
- CMSIS core & neural network libraries
- Source code: acquisition, processing, DAC, etc.
- Makefile + `plot.py` for quick testing

---

## ✅ Dependencies

Make sure the following are installed:

- `gtkmm-3.0` or later
- `libssh`
- `g++`, `make`
- (Optional) `git` for online mode

**Tested on:**
- Ubuntu 22.04+
- RedPitaya STEMlab (with SSH access)
